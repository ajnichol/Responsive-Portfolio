      <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Web Developer with a background in the Nonprofit industry. I acquired my Bachelor's of Science degree from California Lutheran University where I studied Buiness Administration. For the past two year's I've been privelged to work with a successful marketing team at a local Nonprofit called Charitable Adult Rides and Services(CARS), where I was able to bring to life vehicle donation landing sites for our Nonprofit partners. I also recently graduated from The Coding Bootcamp at UC San Diego Extension, where I learned the ins-and-outs of Full Stack Web Development.</p>

      <p>As a web developer, I have a strong passion for developing and designing software applications that not only fully capture and bring to life brands, but that also create memorable user experiences. What truly motivates and excites me is the opportunity of providing the best user experience. </p>
